 After extensive consultation, BharathHospital was designed, constructed and opened in 2013. This purpose built facility initially provided 5 operating theatres, 48 inpatient beds, a two bed HDU, and a procedure room for endoscopy. ch room has a balcony with ranch slider access, Sky TV, free wi-fi and is furnished to a high standard.&nbsp; The rooms are split into three wings, North, West and South.<br />
<br />
In future, Radiology who had plain film imaging facility requested an extension to their rooms for CT and MRI scan.  This development took place and the enlarged facilities. The MRI installed in 2010 was replaced in 2015 with a newer technology model to provide better imaging.<br />
<br />
In 2014 a dedicated day stay facility was opened to meet the increasing demand for day stay procedures. The  centre has two procedure rooms, one for minor surgery and the other specifically for endoscopy.<br />
<br />
Nurses working at Grace have been chosen for their experience in surgical nursing, their passion for providing excellent patient care, and their drive for continuous improvement.<br />
<br />
The first floor of the  centre has two consulting suites – The  Anaesthetic group have moved from their original location to one of the suites which provides them with a larger facility. The other suite is currently being used for nursing pre-assessment clinics.
